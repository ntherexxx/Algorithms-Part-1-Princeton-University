#Introduction
We illustrate our basic approach to developing and analyzing algorithms by considering the dynamic connectivity problem. We introduce the union−find data type and consider several implementations (quick find, quick union, weighted quick union, and weighted quick union with path compression). Finally, we apply the union−find data type to the percolation problem from physical chemistry.
#Learning Objectives

+Design different algorithms (quick find, quick union, weighted quick union, path compression) for the union-find data type.
+Develop Java implementations of different algorithms for the union-find data type.
+Use the parent-link representation to represent tree data structures.
